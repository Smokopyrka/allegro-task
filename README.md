## General Info
Simple REST API written in Flask that can:
* List all repos along with their star counts for a given user.
* Get the sum of star counts of all repos for a given user.
* Get the list of all languages the repos of a given user are written in, along with the number of bytes that have been written in each of them, ranked from the most used language to the least used language by byte count.

## Setup

### Running the application
Make sure you have all the dependencies installed. To do so execute the command `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` in the root directory of the project. To run the application, declare an environment variable `FLASK_APP` and set it to value `app`. Then, go into the `repolist` directory and run the command `flask run`.

**IMPORTANT:**
Due to the request limiting of the GitHub API, which limits the amounts of request for non-authenticated users to 60 requests per hour, it is highly recommended, to authenticate using a GitHub personal authentication token, which can be generated here: https://github.com/settings/tokens.
Upon generating the token, declare the following environment variables, and set them to values given below:
   - `GITHUB_TOKEN=<valid github personal access token>`
   - `GITHUB_USER=<username of the account the token belongs to>`

### Running the tests
To run the tests and get the info about the test coverage achieved run `python3 -m pytest --cov=repolist.logic` in the root directory of the project
